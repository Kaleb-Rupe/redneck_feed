## RF Overview
RF is an example of a local business using up-to-date technology for its website. Large/medium-sized businesses are crushing most small/local businesses with a much larger view of what technology can bring. As developers, we can help with thinking globally but acting locally. As BloomTech students, we just wanted to showcase our skills and abilities for the world to see as we give back to the local community.  

## Initial Setup

- Fork, clone, and `npm install`.
- Launch the project in a development server executing `npm run dev`.
